Hello,
I need a Android app to do some testings on a Bluetooth device.
The app should work on all Android versions and I want to experiment with the Google Studio IDE also.
-The device use a Bluetooth Transceiver RS232 / TTL to UART Module.
-It should be possible to connect/disconnect to the device insert a pairing code for the device and store the settings if it is necessary.
-I want to send one or more separated AT commands to the device
-If I sent more than one command, the next command should be sent with a delay of 100-200ms when a predefined character will be received
-The received data should be displayed in a multiline textbox and it should be possible to save it in a textfile.
The look can be very simple, it is for experimental purposes only.
But it should have exception handling if an error occurs.
It would be great if I can predefine AT commands in the sourcecode for a dropdownbox also, which can be select and sent to the device.

It should also be possible to connect to the same device with a WIFI module instead of the Bluetooth module.
I want to select between WIFI or Bluetooth connection.
